# Quarrel
A simple to use timer designed for but not limited to debate speeches. It allows variable speaker times, alerts at specified times (No need to thank me moderators), and a template system so a link can be shared for preset times. It also has a few "themes".

### Tutorial
A tutorial is shown for first time visitors. However this is a PC only feature because the tooltip system used is hand written and does not deal with mobile screens at all.
